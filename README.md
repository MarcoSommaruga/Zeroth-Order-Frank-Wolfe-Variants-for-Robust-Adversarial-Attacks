## Abstract
In this report, three  Zeroth-Order  Stochastic  Frank-Wolfe  methods  are  analyzed and implemented in order to find a small perturbation that, applied to an image from the famous MNIST dataset, forces the LeNet5 model to return a wrong label for it, without precluding a  human  observer  to  recognise  the  imageâ€™s  original  class.
